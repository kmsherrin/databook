## Intermediate Flask project putting together a slight social network type of site focused on data and collaboration (maybe?)

This was a intermediate project for testing and learning some things that I hadn't previously completed. Some of these things are:
- In's and outs of Flask, including the ecosystem surrounding
- Inbuilt user authentication
- User registration and reset of password email
- Relational database design linking persistent data components, Postgres db hosted on Elephant SQL
- Deployed and hosted on heroku 
- Data uploaded to and read from amazon S3 bucket

TODO's:
- Clean up mobile UI
- Implement an elasticsearch for the Tags and Search
- Add tests for database entries
